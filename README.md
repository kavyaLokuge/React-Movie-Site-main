# WatchTopia - React Movie Site
### Movie/Tv show streaming site

WatchTopia is a React front-end script to stream movies and TV shows for free using publicly available APIs.

In this project, I have used two APIs, 2embed.to and TheMovieDB, to retrieve information about movies and TV shows, including their titles, descriptions, ratings, and streaming links. I tried to build a user-friendly interface using React that allows users to search for their desired movies and TV shows, view details about them, and watch them online.

My goal was to provide a simple yet effective solution for anyone who wants to watch movies and TV shows for free using their web browser.

# Getting Started

* Install Node.js if you haven't already from nodejs.org
* Download the script zip file from the section above
* Extract the zip then open your OS terminal in the new folder
* In your terminal run npm install to install dependencies, then run npm run dev to start the dev server
* Visit the dev server by going to http://localhost:5173 in a browser
* Run npm run build in the terminal to build the production files
* You will get the final site files in /dist which you can upload to your server
* You only need a static server to host this site, so you could use something like Netlify to host it for free.
